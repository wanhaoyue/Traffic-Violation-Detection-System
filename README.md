# Traffic-Violation-Detection-System
This project is a Django-based web application designed to assist JPJ (Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan) in detecting traffic violations and recognizing license plates from user-submitted images. The system leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection, data analytics, and AI-driven recommendations to automate and enhance traffic enforcement processes.

#Features

  License Plate Recognition
  Detects and extracts license plate numbers from submitted images.
  
  Violation Record Management
  Stores detected violations along with relevant details in a structured database.
  
  Dashboard & Analytics
  Provides an admin dashboard with statistics, visualizations, and reports on traffic violations.
  
  AI Recommendations
  Offers insights and recommendations based on historical violation data using CRISP-DM methodology.
